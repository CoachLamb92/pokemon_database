**A database test project highlighting SQL querying**

The following is by no means an exhaustive list, it is just whichever chaotic way my mind was working at time of writing

# To-do list:
## Pressing:
- Create a database for the poke_dicts


## General:
- Create a database for the moves
- Create a database for the abilities

## Stretch:
- Add all Pokemon (Gen 1) to the database

## Completed:
- ~~Access PokeAPI~~
- ~~Add moves from the correct game to the poke_dict~~
- ~~Add level_learnt to the move correctly to the poke_dict~~
