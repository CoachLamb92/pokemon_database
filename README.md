# pokemon_terminal
**A database test project highlighting SQL querying**

The following is by no means an exhaustive list, it is just whichever chaotic way my mind was working at time of writing

# To-do list:
## Pressing:
- Add moves from the correct game to the poke_dict
- Add level_learnt to the move correctly to the poke_dict

## General:
- Create a database for the poke_dicts
- Create a database for the moves

## Stretch:
- Add all Pokemon (Gen 1) to the database

## Completed:
- ~~Access PokeAPI~~
